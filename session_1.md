# Machine Learning for Neural Interfaces










## Learning Outcomes. By the end of the session, you are:
- Excited about ML for Neural Interfaces.
- Able to articulate how the person's conscious experience and intent interacts with measurable physical processes in the brain, and vice versa.
- Aware of the current State of the Art in Brain-Computer Interfaces.
- Acquainted with the bare basics of the dynamical systems framework and of computational architecture of the brain: neurons, synapses, sensory and motor pathways.
- Equipped with knowledge of how intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) works and how it relates to ongoing processes in the brain.
- Prepared for succeeding with the first lab assignment: loading and manipulating human neural data.
- Aware of the scope, logistics, grading criteria and outline of this course.

It is a great pleasure and honor for me to be the person to introduce you to this field. I'll start with a couple of words about me.
%%%TODO%%%

I would like to be very clear about why this course exists.
In my own experience, working with students and leading small teams of researchers, I have come to realize that the combination of being cracked in machine learning and at the same time knowing your stuff in neuroscience is very rare. 

So selfishly, I want to teach you and on-board you so that you could join and contribute to the field.

## idk

Why does this course exist?
It is a ramp


Regardless of whether the soul exists or not, etc, we are going to sidestep those questions and make two claims
1. Conscious processes have a physical manifestation
2. By interacting with the brain, we can modulate conscious processes



## Physical manifestation of conscious processes

## Modulation of conscious processes by interacting with the brain

- Stim of brain areas
- 

## Clarification of course content


## Neural basics
