# Tools for ML for Neural Interfaces

## Learning Outcomes. By the end of the session, you:
- Are equipped with a repertoire of signal processing and modeling methods for iEEG that you can select and evaluate based on the problem at hand.
- Are comfortable to start using open source tools and benchmarks: neuroprobe, temporaldata, brainsets, torch-brain, crane.
- Know about the largest open source iEEG datasets and how to access them in crane through ieeg-data with brainsets.
- Acquainted with current state of the art in neurotechnology and its implications for enabling next-generation brain research and neural interfaces.
- Are prepared to succeed on the second lab assignment: training a small foundation model of neural activity.
