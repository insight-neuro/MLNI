## Course Description

*How can Machine Learning help us decode and modulate human brain activity?*

This course explores the intersection of machine learning and human neural interfaces, introducing students to the emerging field of brain foundation models. Topics include:

- Basics of electrophysiology and neural recording  
- Self-supervised learning for brain signals  
- Neural decoding models  
- Closed-loop stimulation design  
- Ethical considerations in BCIs

The course focuses heavily on direct electrical recording and stimulation of the human brain via microelectrodes, EEG, sEEG, and ECoG, with insights from guest researchers and practitioners.

Students will gain hands-on experience working with real human neural datasets, building models that interpret and potentially enhance neural activity. Suitable for students with a background in machine learning.

Assignments focus on analyzing neural data. The course culminates with a research proposal final project (alternatively, participation in the Boston BCI hackathon).
